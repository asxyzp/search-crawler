# search-crawler
Building a basic search engine crawler in Python which would extract all the links through a seed page &amp; traverse through all the links in the page. The crawled links will be stored in a text file. The crawling will stop depending on the parameter of maximum number of links crawled and/or the path length of the crawled page from the seed page.
